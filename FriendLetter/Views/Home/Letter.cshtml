    <h1>Hello from afar!</h1>
    <p>Dearest @Model.Recipient, friend and pal o'mine,</p>
    <p>How are you!? I hope you're having a great dang day! I am out and about in Japan while taking my online coding bootcamp. Isn't that swell?</p>
    <p>The food is so good here! I'm glad we're walking a lot, I need to work off all the boba tea!</p>
    <p>Programming is also great, you should give it a try if you have a chance.</p>
    <p>But yeah I miss your stinkin face @Model.Recipient! See you soon with a souvenir in hand!!!</p>
    <p>TTFN,</p>
    <p>@Model.Sender, Programmer on the Move</p>
